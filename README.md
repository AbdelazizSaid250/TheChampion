Notes:

- You can use the CRUD operations using the Spring Data REST by calling the endpoint in the dao files
  -
- For example in participant dao, I put annotation 'participant' and if you put those Methods with it
- GET -> /participant -> return the list of participant
- PUT -> /participant -> update participant with the request json.
- DELETE -> /participant -> delete the object by id in the path.
